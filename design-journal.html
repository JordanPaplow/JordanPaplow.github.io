        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p><b>Prompt</b> <br> What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies you’d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p><b>Response</b><br>I would like to aquire a basic understanding of code. I am fairly ignorant of the technologies that exist in this regard, so I have no frame of reference as to which I would like to learn. </p>

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p><b>Prompt</b> <br> What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter?</p>
        <p><b>Response</b><br> For project 1 I am planning on doing a website about the Salmon of the columbia river. I want an initial landing page with a video background. Once you hit "enter" you get sent to a homepage explaining the nature of the site. Then each page has a description of a different species. There are two different layouts for those pages and it will alternate between the two. The color pattern will be "Northwestern" and the Type choices will reflect those used in "Outdoorsy" branding.</p>

        <h2>Week Three</h2>
        <p><b>Prompt</b> <br>This weeks journal prompt, I want you to clearly imagine one user who'll love to use your Project 1 website. Once you've imagined this person. write about them. just a paragraph, three to five sentences. Try to have fun with it. <br></p>
        <p><b>Response</b><br> Gordan Zaplow is crazy about fish. It started when he was young. His first pet was a goldfish named "Licorice", and though Licorice was not long for this earth, he was the first in a near continuous line of auquatic dependants which would be in his care. Every birthday between 5-10 years old, his family would take him to the Montery Bay Aquarium, where he would stare mezermized into the alien world of fins, gills, and scales. This love of fish continued into his adult life. Now in times of stress he will venture off to the Bonneville Hatchery to bask in the soothing presence of Herman the Sturgeon. And every September he sits at the confluence of Tanner Creek and the mighty Columbia to watch the Fall Chinook run take its final sprint. A thousand gasping, scaley racers jockying past the gaping maws of sea lions. Sneaking past the eagle's talons for those final moments of ecstacy and finally death. This carnal ensemble may seem a strange setting for repose. But Zaplow always was a touch peculiar.</p>
        
        <p>"And now to brush up on his basic knowledge of local salmon identification and facts, he visits Salmon of the Columbia. Or did he create it? Creator, creation. Spectator, performer. All is one and all is none."" 
        </p>
        
        <p>Thus Spake Zaplow.</p>

        <h2>Week Eight</h2>
        <p><b>Prompt</b> <br> Read the article on mobile first design and share your thoughts on mobile first vs desktop first.</p>
        <p><b>Response</b><br> The mobile first approach makes sense, as it is easier to expand a simple design than it is to "Dumb down" a complicated, facny design that you might be tempeted to make for desktop. Also as mobile use expands, it makes sense that you would first and formost want your design to look good and funcion well in that format. </p>

        <h2>Week Nine</h2>
        <p><b>Prompt</b> <br> Spend some time thinking about why you are pursuing a career in design. Really dig down, do the 7 "whys" tool in the article.</p>
        <p><b>Response</b><br>
        After reading the article I'm still a little hazy on what the "7 whys method" is. It seems the underlying theme is to discover you "deeper" motivations. So for me it goes something liek this: I want to be a graphic designer. Because I want a marketable job skill and design lends to my natural strengths. I want a marketable job skill because I don't want to work customer service my whole life and I would like the possibility of working remotely. I want to work remotely so that I can live outside of an urban center without having to deal with the commute and hopefully leave the west coast entirely. I want to leave the west coast because the culture is pompous, narcissistic and full of navel gazing, also the cost of living makes homeownership untenable. I would like to own property in order to grow/raise more of my own food and have space to pursue the various interests that I have that would require having tools and workspaces that are impractical living in an apartment.

        I suppose getting back into the more design specific "whys"... I'm a creative person, I have always had a knack for it. But I also don't have much ego attached to making things. So I don't really mind having a creative job that is geared towards fulfilling someone else's vision, as opposed to "expressing myself".
