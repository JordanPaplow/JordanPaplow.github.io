        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p><b>Prompt</b> <br> What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies you’d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p><b>Response</b><br>I would like to aquire a basic understanding of code. I am fairly ignorant of the technologies that exist in this regard, so I have no frame of reference as to which I would like to learn. </p>

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p><b>Prompt</b> <br> What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter?</p>
        <p><b>Response</b><br> For project 1 I am planning on doing a website about the Salmon of the columbia river. I want an initial landing page with a video background. Once you hit "enter" you get sent to a homepage explaining the nature of the site. Then each page has a description of a different species. There are two different layouts for those pages and it will alternate between the two. The color pattern will be "Northwestern" and the Type choices will reflect those used in "Outdoorsy" branding.</p>
