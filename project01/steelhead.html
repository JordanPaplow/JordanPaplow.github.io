          <p>Commonly known as the steelhead trout, coastal rainbow trout, silver trout, salmon trout, ironhead, or steelie this salmon has historically been idolized as a trophy game fish. This species consists of a two runs, a winter and a summer. They differ from other salmon species in that hey can return multiple times to spawn. However the number of returning spawners decreases significantly from year to year with few fourth year spawners. There is a higher mortality rate during steelhead spawning season as they do not feed while in freshwater. They are characterized by their metallic blue backs and silvery sides, and black spots on the back, dorsal and caudal fins. Spawning colors are darker with males having a pink or red band on the sides. They do not have a red dash under lower jaw which distinguishes steelhead from coastal cutthroat. These fish live about 1-4 years, are about 20-30 in in length, and weigh about 5-20 lbs..</p>
