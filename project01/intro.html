      <div id= "intro">There are six species of salmon that can be found today in the Columbia River. Salmon once occupied nearly 13,000 miles of Columbia River Basin streams and rivers. According to conservative estimates, the Columbia River Basin, both above and below Bonneville Dam, once produced between 10 and 16 million salmon annually. These runs generally extended from March through October, though steelhead runs extended through the winter. These numbers have since declined due to over-fishing, destruction of habitat and contruction of dams during the 20th century. This site aims to provide some basic information about these incredible fish.</div>
