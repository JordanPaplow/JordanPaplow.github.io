        My name is Jordan Paplow. I'm a graphic design student at Portland State University. I was born in California, but have lived in Portland for just over 10 years. My favorite passtimes include going for walks around the city, painting, writing to my pen-pals, watching b-movies from the 70-90's, watching depressing foreign films, drinking single malt whiskey and reading books. Last term was my first time working with CSS/HTML, so at this point my skills in the webdesign department are much like my dancing: Terrible, but something I still enjoy.
